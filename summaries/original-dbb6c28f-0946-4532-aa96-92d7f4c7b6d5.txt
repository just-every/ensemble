# OpenAI Realtime API WebSocket Implementation with [1] PCM16 24kHz VAD Transcription

## Overview

The OpenAI Realtime API is a powerful tool for real-time interactions, offering advanced features such as Voice Activity Detection (VAD), interruption handling, and immediate voice or text responses. This tool is ideal for applications [2] like voice-based chatbots, live audio transcription, and interactive conversational agents.

Using this API is quite different from using the OpenAI HTTP inference APIs. The [3] Realtime API is stateful and defines a bidirectional events protocol on top of a long-lived WebSocket connection. It directly handles both text and voice input/output, and unlike the traditional OpenAI REST [3] [4] API, is provided via WebSocket for real-time conversations.

## Audio Format Specifications

The Realtime API specifically supports 16-bit PCM audio (24kHz, mono) as one of its audio formats. The audio chunks sent by the Realtime API are in [2] a PCM 16 format (that is: raw 16 bit PCM audio at 24kHz, 1 channel, little-endian).

Uncompressed 16-bit, 24kHz audio has a bitrate of 384 kilobits-per-second. The base64 encoding overhead pushes the nominal bitrate up to about 500 k [3] [3]bs. But permessage-deflate standard compression will bring the bitrate back down to 300-400 kbs.

Currently, the Realtime API supports PCM16 and G.711 audio (8kHz, u-law/a-law) formats. More formats are expected to be added sequentially, so it's advisable to [1] check the official documentation as needed when using.

## WebSocket Implementation

The API uses WebSockets to maintain an ongoing connection, allowing continuous data exchanges (audio and text) without the overhead of HTTP requests, ensuring real-time interactions with minimal latency. [4]

Because we are dealing with audio, the API keeps sending and receiving messages through a WebSocket. The API sends audio chunks to the model and receives audio chunks as responses. Because we are using a WebSocket, the API is now stateful, which means you no longer need to resend the context of the conversation at [2] each turn.

The OpenAI Realtime API supports text transcription, function calling, and manipulation of the LLM context by defining a set of events that are sent and received via a long-lived WebSocket connection. The API has 9 client events (events that the client sends to the server) and 28 server events (events [2] [1] that the server sends to the client).

Audio is sent and received as base64-encoded chunks embedded in input_audio_buffer.append and audio.delta events. The API currently supports uncompressed 16-bit, 24kHz audio, and compressed G.711 audio.

## Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is a crucial component [5] [6] for real-time voice interactions. It automatically detects when a user speaks.

Turn handling is controlled by the turn_detection property. This property's type can be set to none, semantic_vad, or server_vad as described in the voice activity detection (VAD) and the audio buffer section.

The audio buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later [5] commit. In Server VAD mode, the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server decides when to commit. When server VAD is disabled, the client can choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB. For example, streaming smaller chunks from the client can allow the VAD to be more responsive.

With the semantic_vad mode, the model is [5] less likely to interrupt the user during a speech-to-speech conversation, or chunk a transcript before the user is done speaking.

You can use server-side voice activity detection (VAD) without automatic response generation. This approach can be useful when you want to implement some degree of moderation. Set turn_detection.create_response to false via the session.update event. [4] VAD detects the end of speech but the server doesn't generate a response until you send a response.create event.

## Best Practices

1. **Audio Chunk Size and Frequency**:
   The Audio Worklet generates Float32Array with 128 samples. Because we run at 24kHz, this means we are sending 24000 / 128 = 187.5 chunks per second. This is probably a bit too much for the Realtime API. We don't need to send audio [5] chunks at a very high rate. One audio chunk every ~50ms should be more than enough. That means we could target a chunk size of 24000 * 0.05 = 1200 samples. We can simply buffer the audio chunks in the main thread and send them to the Realtime API when we have enough data.

2. **Connection Protocol**:
   You can use the Realtime API via WebRTC or WebSocket to send audio input to the model and receive [2] audio responses in real time. In most cases, it's recommended to use the WebRTC API for low-latency real-time audio streaming.

3. **Latency Considerations**:
   Humans expect fast responses in normal conversation. A response time of 500ms is typical. Long pauses feel unnatural. If you are building conversational AI applications, 800ms voice-to-voice latency is a good target to aim for, though this is [2] difficult to consistently achieve with today's LLMs. The OpenAI Realtime API delivers very good inference latency. Users consistently see a time-to-first-byte from the API of about 500ms for clients located in the US.

4. **WebRTC vs WebSocket**:
   Audio sent and received over WebRTC is automatically time-stamped so both playout and interruption logic are trivial. These are harder to get right for [2] all corner cases when using WebSockets.

## Limitations and Challenges

1. **WebSocket Complexity**:
   WebSocket reconnection logic is very hard to implement robustly. You will have to build a ping/ack framework (or fully test and understand the framework that your WebSocket library provides). TCP timeouts and connection events behave differently on different platforms.

2. **Bandwidth Requirements**:
    [2] [2]300kbs is a bigger media stream than you generally want to send over a WebSocket connection, if you are concerned with achieving real-time latency.

3. **Audio Quality Processing**:
   Good WebRTC implementations today come with very good echo cancellation, noise reduction, and automatic gain control. (This implies WebSocket implementations might lack these features)

4. **Transcription Limitations**: [6]
   The server conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed event is the result of audio transcription for speech written to the audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (in server_vad mode). Transcription runs asynchronously with response creation, so this event can come before or after the response events. Realtime API models accept audio n [3]atively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate speech recognition model such as whisper-1. Thus the transcript can diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

5. **Beta Status**:
   The Realtime API is still in beta. Please check the latest status before using it.

## Implementation Example

To implement a WebSocket connection [3] [3] with PCM16 24kHz VAD transcription:

Connect to the URL (wss://api.openai.com/v1...) specified in the official documentation for the Realtime API using WebSocket. At this time, set the OpenAI API key in the Authorization header. This API key is the same as the one used for the Chat Completion API, etc. Once connected, a session with the Realtime API is created.

For sending audio:
The audio from the microphone is sequentially written to the standard output stream and sent to the Realtime API in sequence. Use the input_audio_buffer.append event to send input audio, setting the Base64-encoded audio data in the audio property and sending it.

In summary, OpenAI's Realtime API with PCM16 24kHz VAD transcription offers powerful capabilities for real-time audio interactions, but requires careful implementation consideration around audio formatting, latency management, and robust WebSocket handling.
