The best companies use this as an opportunity to **make each customer feel appreciated**. ChargeDesk can help generate beautiful receipts, invoices and billing pages for your payments. The billing pages keep your customers informed about the status of their charges, subscriptions and billing history. Your customers can use these pages to do things like request billing support, cancel a subscription, update their invoices or their card on file for your company. By giving your customer access to all this information, not only will they feel better informed, but your support load will decrease as customers will be able to perform many of the most common billing support requests by themselves.\n-   Send PDF tax invoices to your customers on successful payments\n-   Allow customers to view and manage their subscriptions\n-   Embed customer billing history on your site\n-   Allow customers to update their card on file\n-   Notify customers when a charge is refunded\n-   Show tax information based on your customer's country (VAT & GST compliant)\n-   Customers can add their tax ID to their own invoices\n-   Replies to receipts are sent to your helpdesk with billing details attached\n-   Streamline collecting billing questions to reduce your chargeback rate\n-   Allow customers to update their own invoice details\n[Reduce Your Support Load](https://chargedesk.com/start)\n### Understand your business\n![](https://cdn.chargedesk.com/screen-features-reports.jpg)\nAs a business grows it can be hard to understand changes to your revenue.
